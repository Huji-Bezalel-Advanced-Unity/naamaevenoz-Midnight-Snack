# Midnight-Snack, by Naama Even Oz
A 3D memory-based horror game set inside a fridge. You play as a chocolate snack trying to avoid being eaten by hungry housemates during midnight.

### Description
You are a chocolate snack hidden in the fridge. As long as it is dark, no one opens the fridge.

When the fridge is opened, light comes in, revealing your location, and hands reach in to grab a midnight snack. Your goal is to stay hidden and avoid being eaten!

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Darkness Phase:** The fridge is closed, and you must **rearrange the food items** to hide yourself.
- **Memory Challenge:** You need to **remember the layout** of the fridge because you must adjust it while it's dark.
- **Light Phase:** When the fridge is opened, the light turns on, and you **cannot move**.
- **Avoiding Capture:** Hands will reach for visible food items. If you are exposed, **you lose!**

### How to Play
1. **Memorize the order** of the food items while the light is on.
2. When darkness returns, **move and rearrange the food** to keep yourself hidden.
3. **Survive multiple fridge openings** without being caught!
